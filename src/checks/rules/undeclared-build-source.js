// Deterministic (SCS only): mission 1 of the build review - the build must NOT load or fetch
// remote resources. Everything must ship in the source; the only allowed copy-in is installed
// libraries via `npm ci` (from node_modules). A curl/wget/git-clone/CDN fetch is a reject.
//
// The classification is produced ONCE in the setup phase (analyzeBuild -> addon.buildFiles
// .buildReview, the vendor pattern); this check just reads it. `classification === "remote-fetch"`
// is the error finding (its {{explanation}} is the model's reason). This check also owns the
// FALLBACK lane: when the build could not be classified with confidence - offline / no token
// (analyzed === false), or a build step the linter could not statically bound (unresolved: an
// opaque orchestrator or a network fetch) - the whole build routes to extended manual review,
// so a human reproduces it. The other classifications ("not-from-source", "scs-redundant") are
// owned by their own checks; "ok"/"none" produce nothing.
//
// Belongs here: mapping the stored classification to a finding / manual escalation. Does NOT
// belong here: the analysis (-> src/build/analyze.js), the corpus policy
// (-> build-corpus.js), or the wording (-> assets/registry.yaml).
