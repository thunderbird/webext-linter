// Reports a bundled third-party library that is not declared in VENDOR.md - the
// backup for a forgotten declaration. The classifier identifies it by a content
// HASH match against the known-library database (so we know the exact library and
// version, named on the finding); a declared/vendored file is excluded before
// tagging, so everything that reaches here is undeclared. Info severity: a
// hash-identified library is a precise, byte-verified release, so "not declared"
// is advisory, not a blocker. A bundle the hash DB does not recognize is NOT a
// library here - if minified it falls to minified-code, if obfuscated to
// obfuscated-code, otherwise it is scanned as authored.
//
// Belongs here: selecting the library-tagged verdicts and emitting one finding
// (named with its libraryId) per such file.
//
// Does NOT belong here: the hash lookup and the VENDOR.md exclusion (->
// src/checks/lib/bundled.js, classifyAddonJs; the DB itself ->
// src/checks/lib/library-hashes.js), the minified-without-library verdict (->
// minified-code.js) and the obfuscated-without-library verdict (->
// obfuscated-code.js), authored wording (-> assets/registry.yaml), severity (->
// that registry entry, stamped by src/checks/registry.js), and report formatting
// (-> src/report/format.js).
