// Reports a bundled third-party library that the Mozilla hash DB did not recognize
// but whose exact bytes were found on the jsDelivr CDN (src/lib/cdn-lookup.js,
// run in the pipeline before this check). A CDN match is promoted into the vendored
// family - tagged `library` with a `libraryId` and a `cdn` source URL - so it is
// excluded from minified-code and OSV-audited like a hash-DB library; this check is
// the advisory "you shipped a known library undeclared - here is the VENDOR entry to
// add" report. Info severity, and silent when nothing matched (no `cdn` tags).
//
// Only POPULAR CDN matches are reported here. A CDN match that did not clear the
// popularity trust bar (cdn-lookup.js sets `cdn.popular`) is tagged `untrusted`
// (reviewed as authored code -> untrusted-library / untrusted-minified-library),
// not a trusted "declare it" library, so this check skips it.
//
// Belongs here: selecting the cdn-tagged verdicts and emitting one finding (named
// with its libraryId, hinting its jsDelivr source URL) per such file.
//
// Does NOT belong here: the CDN lookup and the tag promotion (->
// src/lib/cdn-lookup.js), the Mozilla-hash library verdict (->
// missing-library.js), the minified-without-library verdict (-> minified-code.js),
// authored wording (-> assets/registry.yaml), severity (-> that registry entry,
// stamped by src/checks/registry.js), and report formatting (-> src/report/format.js).
