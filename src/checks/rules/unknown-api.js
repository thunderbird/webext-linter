// Flags usage of WebExtension APIs not in Thunderbird's annotated schema:
// unknown namespaces, unknown members of a known namespace, and members that
// exist but are explicitly marked `unsupported`. Reads the shared, reachability-
// filtered resolution (lib/api-resolution.js) and emits a verdict per usage. A
// FEATURE-DETECTED (guarded) reference to an unknown MEMBER or an unsupported API is
// skipped, not a finding: the add-on's fallback runs where the API is missing, so
// nothing breaks (usage.guarded from api-usage.js, which is alias-aware - a
// `typeof _api.foo` probe through a captured namespace counts too). An unknown
// NAMESPACE stays a finding even when guarded - a whole missing namespace is far more
// likely a hallucination/typo than a compat probe.
//
// Belongs here: deciding which resolveApi outcomes (unknown-namespace,
// unknown-member, unsupported def) count as a finding (a guarded member/unsupported
// does not; a guarded unknown namespace still does), and picking the item string
// (root.first-segment for an unknown namespace, else the full path).
// Does NOT belong here: resolving usage against the schema over the WebExtension
// tree - that is the shared src/lib/api-resolution.js (resolveApiUsages).
// Extracting browser.* usage from source - src/parse/api-usage.js. Walking the
// schema (isUnsupported, docUrl) - src/schema/index.js. Authored wording ->
// assets/registry.yaml. Severity -> that registry entry, stamped by runChecks
// (src/checks/registry.js). Report formatting -> src/report/format.js.
