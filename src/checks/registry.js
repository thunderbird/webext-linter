// registry.yaml is the check registry. Its check-bearing sections ARE the phases -
// `invalid-experiment-phase`, `deterministic-phase`, `llm-phase`, `post-summary-phase`
// (PHASE_SECTIONS) - so a check's phase IS the section it lives in, and no entry declares
// one. Every entry there that carries a `check:` field links to a module in ./rules/ that
// implements that test. This loader reads the yaml, imports the linked module for each
// (selected) entry, runs it, and stamps each returned finding with the entry's id (the
// check filename stem) and its severity. runChecks names the phases it runs, in order, so
// a section it never asks for is inert.
//
// A check is a pure detector: it decides verdicts and emits findings carrying
// only `file`/`loc`/`item`/`hint` - never prose. The registry entry is the
// check's declarative contract: `severity` (the source of a finding's impact,
// stamped unconditionally - UNLESS it is `auto`, which delegates the per-finding
// severity to the check), and the text shown for it (`response`, `instructions`,
// `prompt`). Neither half leaks into the other.
//
// A deterministic check returns `Finding[]`. An llm check runs a deterministic
// pre-flight and returns `{ findings, escalations }`, where each escalation is a
// case it could not settle. The orchestrator (runChecks) - the sole authority on
// manual review - resolves every escalation via escalation.js: with a token it
// asks the LLM, otherwise (or on unsure/error) it routes the case to manual
// review. So only llm checks can defer to manual, and only the orchestrator
// decides.
//
// The shared `ctx` passed to run() is the RunContext typedef below, which is the
// one description of it: what a check may read, and from where.
//
// Belongs here: the Registry class (the queried view of registry.yaml), loading
// and filtering rule modules, the RunContext type, and runChecks - the loop
// that runs checks, resolves escalations, and stamps id + severity. Does NOT
// belong here: building the ctx, which is src/checks/context.js. The per-case
// escalation policy - src/checks/escalation.js. Any check's detection logic - a
// module under src/checks/rules/* (shared analysis in src/lib/*).
// Resolving a ruleId to user text and laying out the report -
// src/report/responses.js and src/report/format.js.
