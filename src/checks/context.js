 * The check-facing artifact: the routed add-on projected to only its INTRINSIC data - the
 * fields a check legitimately reads off ctx.addon. An ALLOWLIST, not a strip: a field not
 * named here CANNOT reach a check, so a new Addon field can never leak onto the check surface
 * by omission (a blocklist would leak until someone remembered to delete it - which is how
 * buildFiles once exposed the SCA build tree to input:source checks). If this list is ever
 * INCOMPLETE, a check reads undefined and the tests fail loudly - the safe failure direction.
 *
 * `files` is copied BY REFERENCE: buildShippedCtx detects the single-artifact XPI case by
 * `ctx.addon.files === xpiAddon.files`. `vendor`/`bundled` are the pipeline's pre-computed,
 * reconciled classification (the lazy fallbacks would recompute a less-complete one).
 * `nodeModules`/`archives`/`buildReview` serve the SCA build corpus (reviewView also projects
 * addon.buildFiles for the input:build checks); they are undefined on the review/manifest
 * routes, which is harmless. The lazy caches (locales/evalScan/outboundSinks/
 * permissionAnalysis/apiResolution, and the bundled fallback) attach themselves on demand via
 * `ctx.addon.X ??= …`, so they need no seeding.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ABSENT: manifest/manifestError/manifestLoc and experiments are
 * shipped-authoritative and exposed as ctx.manifest / ctx.experiments (so a check cannot read
 * one artifact's manifest against another's files); buildFiles is the wrong artifact for a
 * review check; source/kind/skipped are read by no check.
