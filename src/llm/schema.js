// The provider-agnostic LLM contract: the two forced structured-output schemas
// (RESULT_SCHEMA / ADDON_REVIEW_SCHEMA) and the defensive coercion of the
// model's answer into typed results. Both providers (anthropic.js, openai.js)
// drive the model to return JSON matching these schemas - Anthropic via a forced
// tool_use, OpenAI via a forced function call - and run the raw JSON through the
// same coercers, so the rest of the tool sees one shape regardless of provider.
//
// Belongs here: the schemas, the tool/function names, the allowed enum sets, the
// coercers, and the result typedefs. Does NOT belong here: the HTTP calls (->
// anthropic.js / openai.js), the per-review add-on context and transport (->
// src/checks/llm-client.js), or any prose prompt (-> the registry).

// outcome to something it was not asked about - the identity of every finding/note
// is owned by the orchestrator. The verdict is three-way so an unsure model defers
// to a human instead of silently passing. The reason is a short justification; a
// check may surface it (or the optional additionalInformation, extra detail it
// asked for in its rubric) to the developer, or keep it feed-only.
