// The network half of vendor resolution, run ONCE before normalize and review.
// resolveVendor (offline) settled the no-url / untrusted / unpinned cases into
// addon.vendor.results. This step does the work that needs the network and
// writes its results into the same shared store, so the review-phase checks
// only read it (nothing is fetched twice).
//
// Two sources are verified:
//   - VENDOR entries that are trusted-host + pinned: fetch the declared URL and
//     EOL-tolerant compare against the packaged bytes (verified / modified),
//     then gate on popularity (verified / not-popular) - except a github source
//     from a first-party trusted org (e.g. github.com/thunderbird/...) is
//     accepted by provenance, skipping the popularity bar. An unfetchable URL is
//     escalated to manual review. An npm-sourced entry is also OSV-audited
//     (auditNpm); a github-sourced one (bar a first-party org) is run through
//     auditGithub, which tries to PROVE an npm twin by content-hash match (the
//     deterministic repo-name candidate, then an optional LLM-proposed name,
//     always re-proved by hash) and audit it, recording the rest as unaudited.
//   - package.json dependencies pinned to a version: fetch the published file
//     listing from unpkg ONCE (it carries a per-file sha256 integrity) and mark
//     vendored any packaged file whose content hash matches a published file's
//     integrity - matched locally, no file bytes downloaded, so it scales to a
//     large package. A file that does not hash-match is left alone, as it may be
//     the author's own code or a modified copy. The same pinned name@version is
//     also audited against OSV (auditNpm); known advisories are recorded for
//     the vendor-vulnerable check.
//
// Belongs here: verifyVendor (the batch), the per-source compare, the popularity
// lookup, and the default network transport. Does NOT belong here: URL
// classification (-> sources.js), the offline parse (-> resolve.js), the host
// allowlist + thresholds (-> config.js), and the finding/manual routing (-> the
// four vendor checks + registry).
