// Classifies each JS or CSS file once into { library, minified, obfuscated } for
// the missing-library, minified-code and obfuscated-code checks. `library` is a
// TRUE content-hash match against the known-library database (a file whose raw
// sha256 is a known release is the library, identified by name@version - see
// src/lib/library-hashes.js). `minified` is a byte/geometry heuristic (line
// length); `obfuscated` is a structural match against a known obfuscator family (see
// src/lib/obfuscation.js).
//
// The classification keys off the raw bytes (the minified geometry, the library hash,
// and the obfuscation detector's parse of the shipped source), so it is resolved ONCE
// up front - before the normalizer reformats files - by the pipeline into addon.bundled
// (classifyBundled), the same "compute once, checks read it" pattern as addon.vendor.
// Were it computed during the review, build/lint mode (which pretty-prints first) would
// change the bytes and miss all three.
//
// Belongs here: classifyBundled (the one-shot classification + non-authored skip
// set) and the per-file tagging it uses. classifyAddonJs / nonAuthoredJs are thin
// readers of the memoized store. The known-library hash DB itself is fetched and
// parsed in src/lib/library-hashes.js.
//
// Does NOT belong here: the rule verdicts and findings - those live in the
// missing-library, minified-code and obfuscated-code rules under src/checks/rules/*. Resolving
// the vendored set it builds on (addon.vendor.set) - src/vendor/resolve.js.
// Extension-set helpers - src/util/files.js.
