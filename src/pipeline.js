// The review pipeline: opts in, a structured Review out. This is the tool's
// core, independent of the CLI front-end (cli.js) - the test harness drives it
// directly. It loads the add-on, resolves and verifies its vendored
// declarations, classifies bundled code, runs the schema review, and fills each
// finding's display text from the registry. It returns the Review. Formatting
// and I/O are the front-end's job. The tool is read-only: it never modifies or
// repacks the submission.
//
// Belongs here: the stage orchestration (runPipeline) and the
// pipeline-level schema-selection helpers (resolveReviewSchema,
// selectSchemaChannel, detectManifestVersion).
//
// Does NOT belong here: the cache/model defaults and behavior toggles -
// src/config.js. The schema channel set + branch names - src/schema/fetch.js.
// Argv parse, validation, and printing (src/cli.js and
// src/report/format.js); each stage's own work - add-on load
// (src/addon/load.js), vendor resolution/verification (src/vendor/*), schema
// fetch/load/index (src/schema/*), check orchestration and run context
// (src/checks/registry.js and src/checks/context.js), and all user-facing text
// (src/checks/registry.js plus src/report/responses.js).

  //
  //   xpiAddon - the built XPI (the positional addonPath). The SHIPPED artifact,
  //     authoritative in BOTH modes for the manifest, the experiments, and the
  //     behavioral LLM summary (what actually runs on a user's machine).
  //   addon    - the deterministic review target (becomes ctx.addon): the readable
  //     code the source-level checks scan. In XPI mode it simply IS xpiAddon; in
  //     SCA mode it is the readable source at scaSource - a synthetic addon whose
  //     files are the source but whose manifest is the XPI's (loadScaAddon), so the
  //     checks stay mode-agnostic.
  //
  // So downstream: read `addon` for the code under review, `xpiAddon` for the
  // shipped artifact - no further mode checks. The only other mode forks are the
  // dependency resolution (--sca-root vs the XPI's VENDOR/package.json) and the
  // check gate (ctx.mode -> scaEligible). Minified code is non-authored (and rejected)
  // in both modes: a source-code submission's promise is readable source, so a minified
  // file in --sca-source is rejected like one in an XPI, not scanned as authored.
  // --sca-source may name a nested subfolder OR the archive root itself (a flat
  // layout: manifest.json at the root, with the build tooling intermingled). The root
  // case (scaRootRelative resolves ".", an absolute root, or a literal match all to "")
  // is handled throughout: loadScaAddon reviews every file, and selectScaBuildFiles still
  // traces the build off the root package.json (there is no source subtree to exclude).
  // --sca-root alone switches to SCA mode; --sca-source is optional and defaults to "."
  // (the whole root reviewed as the source - the common flat-layout case).
  //
  // `preliminaryMode` sizes the Setup feed only (the counter is fixed before the first
  // step). The EFFECTIVE mode is resolved below (resolveReviewMode) once the XPI is
  // classified: a false SCA - one whose shipped XPI is directly reviewable - downgrades to
